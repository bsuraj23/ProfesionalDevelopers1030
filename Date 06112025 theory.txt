Difference Between Break and Continue:

**Break:

It stops the loop Completely, even if the loop condition is still true or there are more items left to iterate.

Example:

for i in range(5):
    if i == 4:
        break
    print(i)

o/p: 0,1,2,3

**Continue:

It is used to skip the rest of code in the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration of loop.

Example:

for i in range(1,6):
    if i == 3:
        continue
    print(i)
o/p: 1
     2
     4
     5



Pass:
    
    *Pass is a null stamen - it does nothing when executed
    
    *It is used as temporary placeholder when writing code 
  
    *To avoid Syntax errors when you want to leave something blank

 Example:
   
  for i in range(3):
      if i == 2:
          pass   # do nothing
      print(i)



**Loops:

*For loop:

It is used when number of iterations is known.

It is based on sequence items

Example:  
   
   for i in range(1,6):
       print(i)


*While loop:

It is used when number of iterations is unknown.

A while loop is repeated as long as condition is true. 

It is based on logical condition.

Example:

count = 0
While count < 5:
   print(count)
   count += 1


Q.    Is Python Supports Increment or decrement operator?

Ans.  python does not support increment(++) or decrement(--) operators.
      if we try them, they won't give an error, but they won't increment or decrement the variable. 
      Does not support ++ or -- to avoid confusion and complexity . it prefers readable, simple and predictable code.
      Variables in python are references to objects, not memory locations. so operators like ++ or -- don't fit its design.

Q.    difference between a=a+1 and a+=1.

Ans.  a=a+1   - It creates a new object and assigns to a.(it means adds 1 to a and stores result in a new memory location)
     
      a+=1    - It Tries to update the same object(in place).( means Adds 1 to a and updates the same variable if possible
