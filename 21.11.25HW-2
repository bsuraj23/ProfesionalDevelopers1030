1.what is java script
JavaScript is a programming language used to make web pages interactive and dynamic.
HTML builds the structure of a webpage.
CSS styles the webpage.
JavaScript makes the webpage come alive (buttons that respond, animations, forms that validate input, etc.).
What JavaScript can do:
  1.Show or hide content when you click a button
  2.Validate form input (e.g., check if an email is valid)
  3.Create animations and visual effects
  4.Build web applications (like Google Maps, YouTube, or web games)
  5.Communicate with servers to load data without refreshing the page (using APIs)


2.what is frontend
Frontend refers to the part of a website or application that users see and interact with.
Frontend = everything you see on the screen when you open a website or app.
Examples of frontend things:
  1.Buttons
  2.Text and images
  3.Navigation menus
  4.Colors, fonts, layout
  5.Animations
  6.Forms you fill out
Technologies used in frontend:
  1.HTML – structure of the webpage
  2.CSS – styling and design
  3.JavaScript – interactivity and logic
  
  
  3. What is rest API Architecture 
A REST API is like a set of rules that lets two programs talk to each other using the HTTP methods used by the web (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).
Example:
When your frontend asks your backend for data (like user info), it often uses a REST API.
Key Principles of REST Architecture:  
1. Client–Server
   The client (frontend) and server (backend) are separate.
   They can evolve independently.
2. Stateless
   The server does not remember the client’s previous requests.
   Every request must contain all needed information.
3. Resource-Based
   Everything is treated as a resource, identified by a URL
4. Use of JSON/HTTP
   REST usually uses:
   JSON for data format
   HTTP for communication
5. Cacheable
   Responses can be cached to improve speed.


 4.how do you manage traffic in web application
 Managing traffic in a web application is about ensuring your site or app remains fast, stable, and available even when many users access it at once. 
 This is a key part of scalability and performance optimization. Here’s a detailed breakdown:
1. Load Balancing: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers so no single server is overwhelmed.
2. Caching: Store frequently accessed data closer to the user to reduce server load.
3. Auto-Scaling: Automatically add or remove servers based on traffic demand.
4. Rate Limiting & Throttling: Control the number of requests a user or client can make in a given time.
