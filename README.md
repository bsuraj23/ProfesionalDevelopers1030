1️⃣ Web Applications in Python

Python provides frameworks for building web apps:

Frameworks: Django, Flask, FastAPI, Pyramid, Bottle, Web2Py
Types of Apps: E-commerce, social networks, REST APIs, dashboards, CMS, authentication systems


2️⃣ Git – 10 Common Commands

git init, git clone, git status, git add ., git add <file>,
git commit -m "", git push, git pull, git branch, git checkout


3️⃣ What is GitHub?

GitHub is a cloud platform for hosting Git repositories.
It supports collaboration, version control, pull requests, issue tracking, and CI/CD integration.


4️⃣ Compiler vs Interpreter

Compiler: Converts full code at once, faster, errors after compilation

Interpreter: Executes line-by-line, slower, errors shown immediately

Examples: Compiler → C/C++, Interpreter → Python/JS


5️⃣ HackerRank, Project Euler, Boot.dev

HackerRank: Coding practice & interview prep

Project Euler: Math-based logical programming problems

Boot.dev: Backend learning platform (Python, Go, databases)


6️⃣ TDD & BDD

TDD: Write tests first → write code → refactor

Ensures fewer bugs, cleaner code

BDD: Focuses on user behavior using Given-When-Then

Improves communication & clarity of requirements


7️⃣ Features of a Web Application

Authentication, database connectivity, API communication, dynamic UI, security, logging, responsiveness, and scalability.


8️⃣ What is SQL?

SQL is used to manage relational databases.

Uses: Create tables, insert/update/delete data, queries, joins, permissions.
Example:

SELECT * FROM users;


9️⃣ Why Use Environment Variables?

They store sensitive configurations outside the code.

Benefits: Secure, customizable for environments (dev/test/prod), portable.
Examples: SECRET_KEY, DATABASE_URL, API_KEY


1️⃣0️⃣ Compilation vs Interpretation

Compiler: Converts full code at once, faster, errors after compilation

Interpreter: Executes line-by-line, slower, errors shown immediately

Examples: Compiler → C/C++, Interpreter → Python/JS


1️⃣1️⃣ What is Web Scraping?

Automated extraction of website data.

Uses: Research, price tracking, automation
Tools: BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Selenium, Requests


1️⃣2️⃣ ChatGPT vs Gemini vs Claude vs DeepSeek

Model	Strength
ChatGPT	Best coding & reasoning
Gemini	Best search & multimodal
Claude	Best writing & safety
DeepSeek	Fast & cost-efficient


1️⃣3️⃣ What is REST API?

REST APIs use HTTP methods (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE) to enable stateless communication between client and server using JSON/XML.


1️⃣4️⃣ What is an OS?

Software that manages hardware and provides services for applications.

Examples: Windows, Linux, macOS, Android
Functions: Memory, process, file, device, and security management.


1️⃣5️⃣ Features of Python

Simple syntax, interpreted, cross-platform, large libraries, supports OOP, huge community, used in AI/ML, web dev, automation, data science.


1️⃣6️⃣ TDD & BDD 

TDD: Tests → Code → Refactor

BDD: User-focused scenarios (Given-When-Then)
