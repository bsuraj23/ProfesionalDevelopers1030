1) What are the web applications used in Python?

Python provides frameworks for building web apps.

Popular Frameworks: Django, Flask, FastAPI, Pyramid, Bottle, Web2Py
Types of Applications: E-commerce, social media, REST APIs, dashboards, CMS, authentication systems

2) Git – 10 Common Commands

git init, git clone, git status, git add ., git add <file>,
git commit -m "", git push, git pull, git branch, git checkout

3) What is GitHub?

GitHub is a cloud platform to store Git repositories.
It supports collaboration, version control, pull requests, issue tracking, and CI/CD pipelines.

4) Difference Between Compiler and Interpreter

Compiler: Converts entire program at once, fast execution, errors shown after compilation.

Interpreter: Executes line-by-line, slower, errors shown immediately.

Examples: Compiler → C, C++; Interpreter → Python, JavaScript

5) What are HackerRank, Project Euler, and Boot.dev?

HackerRank: Coding & interview preparation platform

Project Euler: Math + logic programming challenges

Boot.dev: Backend development learning platform (Python, Go, databases)

6) What is TDD and BDD?

TDD (Test-Driven Development): Write tests first → write code → refactor
BDD (Behavior-Driven Development): Focuses on user behavior using Given-When-Then

7) What are the features of a web application?

Authentication, database connectivity, dynamic content, API integration, security, responsiveness, logging, scalability.

8) What is SQL?

SQL is a language to manage relational databases.

Uses: Create tables, insert/update/delete data, queries, joins
Example:

SELECT * FROM users;

9) Why do we use environment variables?

They store sensitive configuration outside code.

Benefits: Secure, environment-based settings, easy updates, portability
Examples: SECRET_KEY, DATABASE_URL, API_KEY

10) What is the difference between compilation and interpretation?

(Already explained in Q4 — same concepts)

11) What is web scraping?

Automated extraction of data from websites.

Uses: Research, analytics, price tracking
Libraries: BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Selenium, Requests

12) What is the difference between ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and DeepSeek?
Model	Strength
ChatGPT	Best coding & reasoning
Gemini	Best search & multimodal tasks
Claude	Best writing & safety
DeepSeek	Fast & cost-efficient

13) What is REST API?

REST APIs use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for stateless communication between client and server using JSON/XML.

14) What is an OS?

An Operating System manages hardware and provides services to applications.

Examples: Windows, Linux, macOS, Android
Functions: Memory, process, file, device, and security management

15) What are the features of Python?

Simple syntax, interpreted, cross-platform, huge libraries, supports OOP, widely used in AI/ML, automation, and web development.

16) What is TDD & BDD?

TDD: Tests first → code → refactor

BDD: User-focused scenarios written in natural language (Given-When-Then)
