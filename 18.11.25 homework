1.What is a Flag in Python?
A flag is usually a Boolean variable (True or False) used to control the flow of a program.
Example:
is_running = True
while is_running:
    print("The program is running...")
    is_running = False  # turn the flag off
Here, is_running is a flag.
While the flag is True, the loop continues.
When it becomes False, the loop stops.


2.Flags in match?
In Python, “flags in match” usually refers to regular expression (regex) flags used with functions like re.match(), re.search(), or re.compile().
These flags change how the pattern matching works.
They are written as re.FLAGNAME.
Common Regex Flags in Python
re.IGNORECASE or re.I	Makes the match case-insensitive
re.MULTILINE or re.M	^ and $ match at every line, not just the whole string
re.DOTALL or re.S	. matches any character, including newline
re.VERBOSE or re.X	Allows you to write regex with spaces and comments
re.ASCII or re.A	Makes \w, \d, etc. match ASCII only
re.UNICODE	Makes \w, etc. use Unicode rules (default in Python 3)
Example:
Using match with flags
Case-insensitive match
import re
pattern = r"hello"
text = "Hello World"
match = re.match(pattern, text, re.IGNORECASE)
print(bool(match))  # True


3.what is oauth 2.0 in python?
OAuth 2.0 in Python is a way for your Python program to access a user’s data from another service (Google, GitHub, Facebook, etc.) without needing their password.
Key Concepts in Python OAuth 2.0 Implementation:
Client Application: The Python application seeking access to protected resources.
Authorization Server: The service that authenticates the user and issues access tokens (e.g., Google, Facebook).
Resource Server: The service hosting the protected user data (e.g., Google Drive, YouTube API).
Scopes: Define the specific permissions the client application requests (e.g., read-only access to user's profile).



4.what are the features of web applications in python?
python web applications offer:
1.Easy development
2.Powerful frameworks (Django, Flask, FastAPI)
3.URL routing
4.Database support
5.Template engines
6.Strong security
7.API development
8.async support for speed
9.Testing tools
10.Easy deployment
11.Extensibility


5.what is responsive web application in python?
When you build a web app using Python (Flask, Django, FastAPI, etc.):
Python handles the server, logic, database, and routes.
The web browser displays HTML + CSS.
CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, or media queries make the layout responsive.
So, the responsiveness comes from frontend design, but the app itself is powered by Python 
A responsive Python web app typically includes:
1.Flexible layouts
2.Media queries

6.what is conflict in github?
A conflict in GitHub occurs when two branches make different changes to the same part of a file, and Git cannot automatically merge the changes. Common scenarios include editing the same line of code, or one branch editing a file while another deletes it. To resolve a conflict, you must manually intervene by identifying the conflicting code, deciding which changes to keep, and then committing the merged changes.  
What causes a conflict
Editing the same line: Two different branches modify the exact same line of code, and Git doesn't know which version is correct. 
Editing vs. Deleting: One branch modifies a file, while another branch deletes the same file. 
Renaming vs. Editing: A file is renamed in one branch but modified in another.
