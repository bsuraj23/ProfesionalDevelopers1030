**1. Time Complexity:


Time complexity measures how much time an algorithm takes to run as a function of input size (n).

It helps compare algorithms’ efficiency regardless of hardware or programming language.

Common Time Complexities:

O(1)	          Constant Time	         Accessing an array element
O(log n)	  Logarithmic            Time Binary Search
O(n)	          Linear Time	         Linear Search
O(n log n)	  Log-Linear Time	 Merge Sort, Quick Sort
O(n²)	          Quadratic Time	 Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort
O(2ⁿ)	          Exponential Time	 Recursive Fibonacci
O(n!)	          Factorial Time	 Traveling Salesman Problem

Types:

Best Case: Minimum time taken (ideal scenario)

Average Case: Expected time for random inputs

Worst Case: Maximum time taken (guaranteed upper bound)

**2. Space Complexity:

Space complexity measures how much memory an algorithm uses during execution.

It includes:
----------------
*Input space

*Auxiliary space (extra/temporary memory)

*Output space


Time Complexity → Performance speed

Space Complexity → Memory efficiency
