1. List: An ordered, mutable collection of items.
Syntax: Enclosed in square brackets [].
Ordered: Elements maintain their insertion order and can be accessed by index.
Mutable: Elements can be added, removed, or modified after creation.
Allows duplicates: Can store multiple identical elements.
Example: my_list = [1, "apple", 3.14, "apple"]

2. Tuple: An ordered, immutable collection of items.
Syntax: Enclosed in parentheses ().
Ordered: Elements maintain their insertion order and can be accessed by index.
Immutable: Elements cannot be added, removed, or modified after creation.
Allows duplicates: Can store multiple identical elements.
Example: my_tuple = (1, "banana", 2.71)

3. Set: An unordered, mutable collection of unique items.
Syntax: Enclosed in curly braces {}.
Unordered: Elements do not have a defined order and cannot be accessed by index.
Mutable: Elements can be added or removed after creation, but the set itself can be modified.
No duplicates: Automatically removes duplicate elements.
Example: my_set = {1, "orange", 3.14}

4. Dictionary: An unordered (in older Python versions, ordered in Python 3.7+), mutable collection of key-value pairs.
Syntax: Enclosed in curly braces {} with key-value pairs separated by colons :.
Key-value pairs: Stores data as pairs, where each unique key maps to a specific value.
Mutable: Key-value pairs can be added, removed, or modified.
Keys must be unique and immutable: Values can be of any type.
Example: my_dict = {"name": "trisha", "age": 22, "city": "hyderabad"}
