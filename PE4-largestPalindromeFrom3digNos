'''
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. 
The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 =91×99.
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
'''

# we need 2 three digit nos.(x,y) s.t when x*y forms a palindrome
# so x,y should range from 100 to 1000 so a for loop for that
# palindrome logic = x*y[::-1]==original  

palin=0
for i in range(100,1000):
    for j in range(100,1000):
        n=i*j
        if str(n)==str(n)[::-1]:    #integer cannot be sliced so convert it to a string
            if n>palin:
                palin=n
print("largest palindrome =", palin)


'''
Explanation:
1. 2 3-digit integers i and j , specify the range (100,1000)
2. i*j and store it in a variable n.
3. if i*j = rev(i*j) i.e if reverse of n = i*j
4. check if n>0
    (We want the largest palindrome, not just any palindrome.
    As we loop through all products, we may find many palindromes.
    We only want to save the biggest one found so far.)

 EX:
       Start: palin = 0

    n = 121 → bigger than 0 → palin = 121
    n = 252 → bigger than 121 → palin = 252
    n = 323 → bigger → palin = 323
    n = 99 → NOT bigger → ignore
    n = 545 → bigger → palin = 545
    n = 484 → NOT bigger → ignore
    n = 202 → NOT bigger → ignore
    Final answer: 545

palin keeps track of the current biggest palindrome.

5. print palin as it contains the biggest palindrome
