**Features of Python:

1. Interpreted Language

Python code is executed line by line by the interpreter.
➡ No need for separate compilation steps like in C or Java.
   Easier debugging and quick testing.

2.Dynamically Typed

You don’t need to declare variable types explicitly.
Python automatically detects the type at runtime.

x = 10     # integer
x = "Hello"  # now string
Saves time and makes code flexible.

3. Object-Oriented

Python supports Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) —
concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.

4. Portability

Python programs can run on any operating system
(Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.) without modification.
 Write once, run anywhere.

5. Extensive Libraries and Modules

Python has a large standard library and thousands of external libraries (like NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow).

Useful for web development, data analysis, AI, and more.


6. Free and Open Source

Python is free to download, use, and modify.
Its source code is open to everyone.



7. High-Level Language

Python handles memory management and complex details automatically.
➡ we can focus on solving problems, not on managing system details.

8. Embeddable and Extensible

Python code can be combined with C/C++, and vice versa.
Helps integrate Python into other programming environments.

9. Large Community Support

Python has a huge global community, tutorials, and online forums.
Easy to get help and learn from others.
